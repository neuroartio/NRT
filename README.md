# NRT
Neuroart is an ecosystem built on the fusion of NFT and neural networks. Everyone, regardless of skills and talents can become a creator of unique NFT cards. These cards can be used in a game that is not time-consuming, but deep enough tactically. 
The first game will be based on generating unique creatures consisting of parts of different animals. Cards with images of these creatures will have characteristics according to the body parts that make it up. The player will be able to participate in PVE, PVP events, where he can extract valuable resources for the development and progress in the game, as well as NRT token. Cards and resources can be traded on the internal market.

The goal of the Neuroart ecosystem is to bring people together around technology development, developing innovative solutions for the video game industry. 
The community will be able to influence the development of the project, for charitable initiatives.
